This dataset is the code and data of the algorithm for finding the singleton attractors and pre-images 
in strong-inhibition Boolean networks. It contains 

    (1). five datas are the networks of the Cancer cell, Budding_yeast, Arabidopsis, Thelper_cell and Tcell_receptor 
in the format of .dat, respectively.

    (2). two codes: one is the code of the algorithm for finding the singleton attractors (SingletonAttractors.for); 
the other is the code of the algorithm for finding the pre-images (Preimage.for).
